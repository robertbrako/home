Greetings, you've reached at Robert Brako's homepage.

This site will largely serve as a portfolio; look forward to the following:
<ul>
<li>Java Programs (e.g. User-Interface and Math Implementations)
<li>3D Model: Downtown Minneapolis along Nicollet Mall
<li>2D Design: posters and boards made while serving as a Communications Director
<li>Perhaps a few old-fashioned drawings
<li>Perhaps score excerpts of some piano compositions
</ul>
The focus will be on computer programs and 2D design, as I am planning a career transition from law to UX design, but the others may find their way into the mix.
