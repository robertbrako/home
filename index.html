<p style="margin-left: 5%; width:90%"><strong>Greetings, you've reached Robert Brako's homepage.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; width:90%"><!-- I know, I know; I'll take care of the repetition later-->
I'm just your average Minnesotan with African parents who grew up in a small town.  My hobbies include 2D and 3D design, and I do some programming (I use Java for the good stuff).  I'll say I know CSS once I improve the layout here...</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%; width:90%">Most importantly, I can make peanut butter soup.  If you haven't eaten that yet, then you have some catching up to do!  With that said, I hope you enjoy my site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%; width:90%">Sincerely,
<br>
<br>
<br>Robert M. Brako
